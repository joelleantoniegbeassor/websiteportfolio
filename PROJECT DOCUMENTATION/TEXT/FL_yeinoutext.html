    <h1>The Wisdom of Feeling Lost </h1> 
    <p class="anweisung">a text by <a href="../../PEOPLE/TEAM/yeinou.html">Yèinou</a></p> 

        <p class="text">
            What is unknowable will always exceed what can be known.<br><br>
            In an infinite universe, the unknown is fundamentally and inherently greater than the
            known.<br><br>

            To accept not to know.<br>
            To accept that being lost is a deep kind of consciousness that connects us all to how strange
            and absurd it is to be alive and conscious.<br>
            To accept that we aren't only put in categories, we partake in the constant categorization
            that keeps us imprisoned.<br>
            To accept that loneliness is a given at this point in time.<br>
            To accept that building communities isn't possible when our collective consciousness is still
            focused on the self.<br><br>

            We are hard wired to think a certain way.<br>
            We are taught from the moment we're born what to view as normal and abnormal.<br>
            It's not our fault that our starting point in life is already biased.<br>
            We have all been conditioned to divide, define, exclude, judge ourselves and what is around
            us.<br>
            I have been made a monster by the people around me yes but I myself have consolidated
            this categorization by repeating these beliefs to myself and shaming myself for my mere
            existence.<br>
            The ever so present violence in the world is in all of us on different levels and our
            surroundings, behavioral patterns and made up rules reinforce these beliefs.<br><br>

            Who is not in pain here?<br>
            Who does not feel alone?<br>
            Who does not feel alienated?<br>
            In this room I don't think many feel aligned and at peace with themselves and the world
            around them.<br>
            We are a direct reflection of what is around us.<br><br>

            The unknown is far greater than the known.<br><br>

            But we wouldn't even have any capacity to try and explore the unknown because we pick
            apart what is known already. Over analyze it, try to find meaning in what is meaningless
            because the absolute shit show we have become as a society is just mind boggeling and
            scary.<br>
            What is known to us is what hurts most of us but it's what feels safest to us.<br>
            We try to distract ourselves from this reality by decorating our surroundings. Consuming,
            adding glitter to burning trash.<br>
            This is how I feel as a monster.<br>
            I have made my cage, my body, physical and social appearance very pretty but I myself even
            if accepted from the outside, romanticized from the outside, admired from the outside am
            living in my own self-inflicted prison. Because I've been taught that that is safer, than trying
            to step out of that cage.<br><br>

            We talk about our experiences as monsters.<br>
            How lonely it is.<br>
            How society has pushed us aside, pushed us into a corner.<br>
            Forced us to adapt.<br>
            Conditioned us to adapt, to want to adapt.<br>
            I wanted to adapt so much that in preparation to this performance I didn't want to partake,
            to share my truth, my feelings on the matter.<br><br>

            I felt so much shame.
            I feel so much shame.<br><br>

            I didn't want to speak on this vastly spread human experience because it felt again like some
            sort of exploitation, a cry for help that will never be heard.
            A hoping for understanding, hoping to be held. But then being embraced in a dishonest way.
            I hope you know what I mean.<br><br>

            You've torn us apart, you've broken us and now we stand here, once again with an open
            heart hoping to be a safe haven for others.<br>
            But you know what happens to safe havens, <br><br>
            
            they get destroyed.<br><br>

            This ego driven society has poisoned all our minds that even in this artistic space, where all
            the monsters supposedly find each other, I do not feel safe.<br><br>

            In institutional theatre we try to leave all feelings outside of the rehearsal space but
            they want vulnerability, strength and “realness” on stage. but only if it has been curated.
            And because of that some of us are pushed into a corner and remain unnoticed.
